A basic script to GET API access token
--------------------------------------

<p>Just a simple script that creates a link by fusing your client id and secret, <br> 
with the auth uri and scope</p>

<p>This was primarily created for getting API token from google cloud, haven't <br>
tried in any other cloud services yet</p>

btw it only does 50% of the job, to actually get the key, use postman
<br>
<br>
_Update v1.1_:It now does 80% of job, doesnt require Postman to grab the auth code for now...




**PS:** Have tried with google's API only
